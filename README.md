ShootingStar Team Show

Our shooting game's objective is to get as many points as possible while trying to defeat one boss plane. 
In this game the player earns points by shooting the planes down. The user has a limited amount of lives which is 
dependent on the difficulty settings the player has chosen in the main menu. The lives will be deducted when the 
player hits other planes or gets hit by the boss plane's shot. 

Defeating the boss plane is the main objective of this game. Once they have been defeated the player has then
won the game and a win screen will be displayed. The end score and lives will still be displayed at this screen
for the player to compete with their previous scores.
